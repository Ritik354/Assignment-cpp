/*Create a base class called shape. Use this class to store 2 double type values that
could be used to compute the area of figures. Derive 2 specific classes called triangle
and rectangle from the base shape. Add to the base class a member function
get_data() to initialise base class data members and another member function
display_area() to compute and display the area of figures. Make display_area() as a
virtual function and redefine this function in derived classes to suit their requirements.
Using these 3 classes, design a program that will accept the dimensions of the
shapes interactively and display area*/
